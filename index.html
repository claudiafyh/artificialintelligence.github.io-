   <h2 id = "sec1">Introduction</h2>
   <p><strong>AI applications</strong> include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,[4] having become a routine technology</p>
   <h2 id = "sec2">Defintion</h2>
   <p><strong><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</em></strong></p>is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals
   <h2 id = "sec3">History</h2>
  <p> Artificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R.These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.<br>

  </br>The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the Church–Turing thesis.<br>

</br>The Church-Turing thesis, along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.[19] The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete "artificial neurons". </p>
